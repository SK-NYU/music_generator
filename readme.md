### Abstract

In recent years, a growing interest has been in leveraging machine learning techniques to generate music autonomously. One prominent approach is the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs excel in capturing temporal dependencies and intricate patterns in music, enabling the creation of diverse and expressive compositions. By training RNN models on large datasets, they learn the underlying musical structures and generate novel pieces with similar styles. The process involves training the model on musical sequences and generating new music by sampling from learned probabilities. Challenges include coherence and stylistic requirements, but researchers actively explore techniques to enhance quality and diversity. RNN-based music generation has promising applications in composition assistance, creative inspiration, and personalized music generation, offering exciting opportunities for artistic exploration and pushing musical boundaries.
