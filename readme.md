### Abstract

In this project, we propose two modified ResNet architectures, one small
and one large, with less than 5 million parameters, designed
to achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. After 40
epochs of training, the experimental results demonstrate that
the large model achieved an accuracy of 89 percent, while
the small model achieved an accuracy of roughly 80 percent.
Notably, the large model achieved similar accuracy as the
ResNet-18 framework, while using a smaller amount of parameters, making it more computationally efficient. Greater
performance could be achieved by increasing the number of
training epochs, or incorporating additional techniques such
as data augmentation
